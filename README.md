# Applying Filters to SQL queries

## Objective
The objective of this project was to simulate a real-world cybersecurity investigation by analyzing employee and login attempt data using SQL. As a security professional at a large organization, I was tasked with identifying potential security threats by querying relevant datasets using logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT. The goal was to retrieve specific records that could indicate suspicious activity, such as multiple failed login attempts, unauthorized access attempts, or compromised employee machines.

## Skills Learned  
- SQL Querying for Security Analysis
- Use of Logical Operators 
- Threat Detection 
- Problem Solving in a Security Context  
- Documentation and Reporting  

## Tools Used  
- SQL
- Database Management system(DBMS)
- Cybersecurity Lab Environment
