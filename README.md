# Applying Filters to SQL queries

## Objective
The objective of this project was to simulate a real-world cybersecurity investigation by analyzing employee and login attempt data using SQL. As a security professional at a large organization, I was tasked with identifying potential security threats by querying relevant datasets using logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT. The goal was to retrieve specific records that could indicate suspicious activity, such as multiple failed login attempts, unauthorized access attempts, or compromised employee machines.

## Skills Learned  
- SQL Querying for Security Analysis
- Use of Logical Operators 
- Threat Detection 
- Problem Solving in a Security Context  
- Documentation and Reporting  

## Tools Used  
- SQL
- Database Management system(DBMS)
- Cybersecurity Lab Environment

## Conclusion  
In conclusion, by using SQL queries with various filtering techniques, I was able to efficiently investigate potential security issues within the organization. I employed a combination of the AND, OR, and NOT operators to isolate relevant data from the log_in_attempts and employees tables, ensuring that I could focus on specific login attempts and employee machine information. The use of the LIKE operator and wildcard % further allowed me to filter for patterns, ensuring comprehensive coverage across different scenarios. This approach enabled me to pinpoint potential security incidents and ensure that the necessary updates and investigations were carried out effectively. My experience with SQL has equipped me with the ability to quickly analyze and respond to security concerns, enhancing the overall security posture of the organization.
